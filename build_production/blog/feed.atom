        <p>Well - I just used Jigsaw to build this site.  I started at 6:30 AM, and at the time of writing, it's 7:28 AM on March 25th, 2020.</p>

<p>If you're already comfortable with Laravel, <a href="https://jigsaw.tighten.co">Jigsaw</a> is by far the easiest static-site generation tool I've played with so far - I've tried a few like Gatsby, and Nuxt, and I think they are awesome, but if you're a PHP dev at heart, Jigsaw is goign to be an easier go for you.</p>

<p>This website (davidhallin.com) is totally open-source.  You can take a look at the repo here <a href="https://github.com/hallindavid/davidhallin" target="_blank()">github.com/hallindavid/davidhallin</a></p>

<p>I pushed this website to GitHub pages - which is free hosting for static websites that are open-source.</p>

<p>For <strong>just 1 hour of work</strong> I think it's pretty decent to have a blog themed, all the basic info added, and pushed to production hosting with SSL.</p>

Throughout my career, a huge portion of my regular work comes from creating forms for people.  People always need forms.

<p>Throughout my career, a huge portion of my regular work comes from creating forms for people.  People always need forms.</p>

<p>The regular progression in my situation is this.</p>

<ol>
<li>I spend a bunch of time building a form</li>
<li>The customer likes the form, then tries it</li>
<li>The customer asks for changes to the form because they missed a field, or had an extra field they didn't need</li>
<li>Adding / removing those fields doesn't work in the nice grid layout that I built</li>
<li>Build new Grid layout for fields</li>
<li>Ensure responsive</li>
<li>Fix validation because you were being sloppy when rapidly doing the <code>cmd+x</code> + <code>cmd+v</code> all over the place and broke it</li>
</ol>

<p class="text-center"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/computer-pics-smash-GTTxe2PWPftOU">via GIPHY</a></p>

<p>The idea behind this open-source project is to make it easy to scaffold out forms with the layout/responsiveness and then you can save them as .json files and can go back and modify them if you need to.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - this is using the <a href="https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/" target="_blank()"> BootstrapVue</a> Package - which basically allows us to do Vue.js validation prior to actually posting the form to the backend/api.</p>

<p>So you scaffold out a basic form using the interface - see the gif above.</p>

<p>Here's a super basic example:
<img src="/assets/images/post-2/simple-form.png" class="mx-auto w-full" /></p>

<p>There's not a lot to this one, but you can preview it in different window sizes, and make sure that when you shrink the page down, it looks like this instead
<img src="/assets/images/post-2/small-simple-form.png" class="mx-auto w-full" /></p>

<p>So you take the code export, add it to your project, give it to the customer, and wait for feedback.
You also save a JSON export of your form</p>

<p>It's just got the basic info about your fields, so when the customer comes back, you take that JSON file, re-import it into the BootstrapVueFormBuilder and you can do things like</p>

<ul>
<li>click-and-drag the fields around to re-organize them</li>
<li>resize with instant-preview</li>
<li>make sure the adjusted form is still responsive etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>And when you're doing a form with this tool, it will automatically add the basic vuejs data-bindings for your fields, which often times can be a pain</p>

<p>Anyways, Hope you guys like it!</p>

<p>If you want to try it out, feel free to copy/paste the JSON code above, and go to <a href="https://bootstrapvueformbuilder.com" target="_blank()">bootstrapvueformbuilder.com</a> and import it.</p>
